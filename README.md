Leaf Loans allows Leaf customers to apply for, obtain, and pay off microloans. It works in conjunction with Leafâ€™s core wallet to support the storage and transport of assets across borders.

This repo contains the source code for the Leaf Loans mobile app.

We use Flutter and we follow clean architecture to allow for easy scalability and migration. Since the Leaf Loan app is still a work in progress, having loose coupling between the app logic and third party libraries gives us a much needed flexibility to try different approaches.
